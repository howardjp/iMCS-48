# iMCS-48

This project comes out of two things happen simultaneously.  First,
I am spending more time working in Jupyter notebooks.  Second, I
am trying to learn more about hardware level work and microcontrollers
in particular.  The connect came because I stumbled across Joshua
Milas's excellent [iArm](https://github.com/DeepHorizons/iarm)
interpreter for the ARM instruction set, and I decided to build
right off of it.

This is totally a work in progress and nothing may ever come of it.
